// Task 1: Using concat
// Objective: Merge two or more arrays.
// Task: Create two arrays, one with your favorite sports and one with your favorite hobbies. Use the concat method to merge them into a single array.
// Expected Output: Display the merged array.
let favoriteSports = ["Soccer", "Basketball", "Tennis"];
let favoriteHobbies = ["Reading", "Cooking", "Gardening"];
let mergedArray = favoriteSports.concat(favoriteHobbies);
console.log(mergedArray);

// Task 2: Using splice
// Objective: Modify an array by adding, removing, or replacing elements.
// Task: Create an array of numbers from 1 to 10. Use the splice method to remove the numbers 4, 5, and 6, and replace them with the numbers 40, 50, and 60.
// Expected Output: Display the array before and after the splice operation.

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
console.log("Before splice:", numbers);
numbers.splice(3, 3, 40, 50, 60);
console.log("After splice:", numbers);

// Task 3: Using slice
// Objective: Extract a portion of an array without modifying the original array.
// Task: Create an array of the days of the week. Use the slice method to create a new array that contains only the weekdays.
// Expected Output: Display the original array and the new array.


let daysOfTheWeek = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
let weekdays = daysOfTheWeek.slice(1, 6);
console.log("Original array:", daysOfTheWeek);
console.log("Weekdays:", weekdays);


// Task 4: Using join
// Objective: Convert an array to a string.
// Task: Create an array of words that form a sentence. Use the join method to combine them into a single string with spaces between each word.
// Expected Output: Display the resulting sentence.

let sentenceArray = ["Hello", "there,", "how", "are", "you", "doing?"];
let sentence = sentenceArray.join(" ");
console.log(sentence);

// Task 5: Using sort
// Objective: Sort the elements of an array.
// Task: Create an array of random numbers. Use the sort method to sort the numbers in ascending order.
// Expected Output: Display the sorted array.


let randomNumbers = [9, 3, 5, 1, 8, 6, 4, 7, 2, 0];
randomNumbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);  
console.log(randomNumbers);
